# Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy Analysis for Battery Degradation

This repository provides a reproducible Python implementation to assess the causal relationships between temperature, voltage, and resistance in Lithium-ion battery datasets using **Granger Causality** and **Transfer Entropy** techniques.

## üîç Features

- Generalized for multiple battery datasets (supports batch processing).
- Fully configurable via an external YAML file.
- Performs:
  - Granger Causality Tests
  - Transfer Entropy Calculations
  - Resistance Smoothing and Calculation
  - Visualization of variable relationships
- Modular and ready for reproducibility certification (e.g., Zenodo, Code Ocean).
